# *Requirements*
## General

In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called main.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded

## Tasks ::
0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life

Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
write output to stdout, the standard output stream
format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:

\#advanced
Handle the following length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers:

Handle the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.



11. It's depressing when you're still around and your albums are out of print
